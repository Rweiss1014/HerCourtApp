The communication challenges that we struggled with, I think, were rooted in a lot of emotion and a lot of hurt feelings--a lot of back and forth with text messages, sometimes through email, and just it was not productive. My divorce attorney told me about TalkingParents and suggested that we use it right away. Instantly, I felt like it was a great pause.\n\nUsing TalkingParents just to get us to communicate through a filter is the way I would describe it. I knew, if a message was in there, where I was at emotionally, if I should open it now or later. It also made me pause when writing messages and made me, like, respond instead of react. It took so much stress and pressure off, setting that boundary of, \"This is how we're gonna communicate moving forward.\"\n\nThe biggest benefit that TalkingParents, I believe, has helped my co-parent and I to communicate better and have a healthier functional relationship. It's less hostile. It's less anxiety filled. It's really kind of smoothed out to where I don't have to worry about a lot of the tension and the conflict that we had before.\n\nAnd, obviously, that result is I'm happier. I'm in a better space. And my child is happier, in a better space. And just that importance of communication between myself and the co-parent has really helped just streamline everything. We even tried to not use TalkingParents, like, a year and a half ago, but it just didn't work out.\n\nIt's just easy, and it keeps us both accountable. I just, I believe in this platform, and I think it's so helpful when you're already stressed, when things are already rough, and there's so many emotions attached to each other. And as a parent, and now a single parent, it can be really scary of what... are you doing what's best for your kids? And I just, I tell that to... when people are getting a divorce, start with TalkingParents.\n\nEven if you have a civil divorce, it just makes life a lot easier."}],"hls_enabled":true,"embed_options":{"opaqueControls":false,"playerColor":"096261","playerColorGradient":{"on":false,"colors":[["#2949E5",0],["#8fafff",1]],"on":"false","colors":[["#2949E5","0"],["#8fafff","1"]]},"plugin":{"videoThumbnail":{"on":"true","hashedId":"py7y9ihauh","trimStart":"0","trimEnd":"5","async":"false","clickForSound":{"on":"true","showText":"true"}},"captions":{"on":"true"}},"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","bpbTime":"false","vulcan":true,"branding":"false","roundedPlayer":"0","showCustomerLogo":"false","stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/d4b7002e0369c61a5d38f2c27eef1a3b.png","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/b1ce627f21a102e78cdab5e2552135778724fd5d.bin","width":"1920","height":"1080"},"thumbnailAltText":"Diane Schroeder Shares Her Real Co-Parenting Story","newRoundedIcons":true,"shouldShowCaptionsSettings":true},"embedOptions":{"opaqueControls":false,"playerColor":"096261","playerColorGradient":{"on":false,"colors":[["#2949E5",0],["#8fafff",1]],"on":"false","colors":[["#2949E5","0"],["#8fafff","1"]]},"plugin":{"videoThumbnail":{"on":"true","hashedId":"py7y9ihauh","trimStart":"0","trimEnd":"5","async":"false","clickForSound":{"on":"true","showText":"true"}},"captions":{"on":"true"}},"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","bpbTime":"false","vulcan":true,"branding":"false","roundedPlayer":"0","showCustomerLogo":"false","stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/d4b7002e0369c61a5d38f2c27eef1a3b.png","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/b1ce627f21a102e78cdab5e2552135778724fd5d.bin","width":"1920","height":"1080"},"thumbnailAltText":"Diane Schroeder Shares Her Real Co-Parenting Story","newRoundedIcons":true,"shouldShowCaptionsSettings":true}},"options":{}};
