We were separated for three. The divorce itself took about just under three years from the time that we got separated to the time that the divorce was final. So as you can imagine, when that much time goes by, there were a lot of emotions that came along with that and a lot of arguments. I mean, it was like a full time job for me to document everything.\n\nI had calendars. I had copies of text message chains, I had emails, I had everything in a huge binder. I believe I became a TalkingParents app user probably about halfway through the divorce process. So it was about a year and a half in. I was on a Facebook support group, and I saw many, many, many people who mentioned the TalkingParents app as sort of their lifeline. And I thought to myself, like, this is a great idea to have something that can kind of help me streamline and and can help me with this documentation process. And I immediately signed up and and I've used... I mean, all the features are great.\n\nSome of the features I use most often are the Calendar and the Secure Messaging because that's how my ex and I communicate. But I do think, the most important thing in this entire process is the boys, my kids. I have twin fifteen year old boys. And so making it easier for them when there are so many emotionally charged conversations and so many emotions involved when it comes to their parents--the people that they kind of look up to--I think has been priority number one and something that we both take very seriously. I just think the TalkingParents app has been sort of the person in my corner. When you think you're crazy. When when something, you know, gets miscommunicated and and you're like, \"I swear I texted that, I put that on the calendar, I I communicated this properly,\" and it's not received in that proper way, the TalkingParents app just is that one extra layer of, \"Hey. You did it the right way, and and here's the proof.\""}],"hls_enabled":true,"embed_options":{"opaqueControls":false,"playerColor":"004746","playerColorGradient":{"on":false,"colors":[["#2949E5",0],["#8fafff",1]],"on":"false","colors":[["#2949E5","0"],["#8fafff","1"]]},"plugin":{"captions":{"on":"true"},"videoThumbnail":{"trimStart":"0","trimEnd":"5","hashedId":"5ko1p5biui","on":"true","clickForSound":{"on":"true","showText":"true"}}},"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","bpbTime":"false","vulcan":true,"showCustomerLogo":"false","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/8f344b0b176ea726c2007c43fd7f6427.png","width":"1920","height":"1080"},"stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/d1c9b836f5d3c0137e0d753acebfd276.png","thumbnailAltText":"Shannon Spake Shares Her Real Co-Parenting Story","newRoundedIcons":true,"shouldShowCaptionsSettings":true},"embedOptions":{"opaqueControls":false,"playerColor":"004746","playerColorGradient":{"on":false,"colors":[["#2949E5",0],["#8fafff",1]],"on":"false","colors":[["#2949E5","0"],["#8fafff","1"]]},"plugin":{"captions":{"on":"true"},"videoThumbnail":{"trimStart":"0","trimEnd":"5","hashedId":"5ko1p5biui","on":"true","clickForSound":{"on":"true","showText":"true"}}},"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","bpbTime":"false","vulcan":true,"showCustomerLogo":"false","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/8f344b0b176ea726c2007c43fd7f6427.png","width":"1920","height":"1080"},"stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/d1c9b836f5d3c0137e0d753acebfd276.png","thumbnailAltText":"Shannon Spake Shares Her Real Co-Parenting Story","newRoundedIcons":true,"shouldShowCaptionsSettings":true}},"options":{}};
